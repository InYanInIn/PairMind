Troubleshooting Notes
---------------------

Problem: Application fails to start with "NullPointerException in ConfigLoader".
Cause: Missing environment variable CONFIG_PATH.
Solution: Set CONFIG_PATH=/etc/app/config.json before running the application. Ensure the file exists and is readable.

Problem: User cannot log in.
Cause: Outdated authentication token or incorrect credentials.
Solution: Ask user to re-login. If using API, refresh the token via POST /users/login endpoint. Verify username and password.

Problem: Application crashes immediately after launch.
Cause: Missing dependencies or incorrect Java version.
Solution: Verify that Java 17+ is installed. Run `mvn clean install` to resolve dependencies. Check logs for missing jar files.

Problem: "Port already in use" error on startup.
Cause: The default server port is occupied by another process.
Solution: Edit application.properties and set `server.port` to an available port. Restart the application.

Problem: Cannot connect to the database.
Cause: Incorrect database URL, credentials, or database server is down.
Solution: Check database server status. Verify URL, username, and password in application.properties. Test connection with a database client.

Problem: API returns 401 Unauthorized.
Cause: Invalid or expired authentication token.
Solution: Generate a new token via login endpoint. Ensure the token is sent in the Authorization header as `Bearer <token>`.
