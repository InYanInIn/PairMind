Integration Tips
----------------

1. API Requests
- Always include a timeout of at least 5 seconds when calling external APIs.
- Use exponential backoff for retry logic in case of transient errors.
- Avoid sending more than 10 requests per second to prevent hitting rate limits.
- When possible, batch requests together to reduce the number of HTTP calls.
- Log both request and response bodies during development to help debug issues.

2. Authentication
- Always use secure tokens or API keys for authentication.
- Do not hardcode credentials; store them in environment variables.
- Rotate API keys periodically to reduce security risks.
- Use HTTPS for all API communications to encrypt sensitive data.
- Validate the token expiry before making requests to avoid unnecessary failures.

3. Webhooks
- Ensure your webhook endpoint responds within 3 seconds to prevent retries.
- Always verify the signature of incoming webhook requests to ensure authenticity.
- Log incoming webhooks for auditing and debugging purposes.
- Use idempotency keys if your system might receive duplicate webhook events.
- Test your webhook endpoint with mock payloads before connecting it to production.

4. Error Handling
- Catch network-related exceptions and handle them gracefully.
- For API responses, check HTTP status codes and handle each appropriately:
  - 2xx — success
  - 4xx — client error (fix request)
  - 5xx — server error (retry with backoff)
- Provide clear error messages to downstream systems or logs.
- Implement retry policies only for transient errors; do not retry client-side mistakes.

5. Data Formats
- Always validate JSON or XML payloads against a schema before processing.
- Sanitize all input from external sources to prevent injection attacks.
- Use consistent date/time formats (ISO 8601 recommended) across systems.
- Escape special characters in strings when sending data to APIs.

6. Rate Limiting
- Respect the API provider’s rate limits.
- Implement a client-side rate limiter to prevent accidental overloading.
- Use backoff strategies when rate limits are exceeded.
- Provide informative logs when requests are throttled.

7. Logging and Monitoring
- Log all integration errors with context for easier debugging.
- Monitor API response times and failure rates.
- Set up alerts for repeated failures or latency spikes.
- Store logs in a centralized system for auditing and troubleshooting.

8. Security Considerations
- Never log sensitive information like passwords or tokens in plaintext.
- Validate SSL/TLS certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Limit the IP addresses allowed to access your endpoints where possible.
- Keep dependencies up to date to prevent vulnerabilities.

9. Versioning
- Include API version in all requests if the service supports it.
- Test integrations against new API versions in a staging environment first.
- Deprecate old API calls gradually and provide clear migration paths.

10. Testing
- Write automated tests for your integration flows.
- Mock external services during unit tests to avoid hitting real APIs.
- Perform end-to-end tests in a staging environment to catch real-world issues.
- Test error scenarios explicitly to ensure proper handling.

11. Documentation
- Maintain clear documentation for integration setup steps.
- Include examples for request payloads and expected responses.
- Document error codes and recommended handling procedures.
- Update documentation whenever the integration logic or external API changes.

12. Deployment Tips
- Use environment-specific configurations for dev, staging, and production.
- Never deploy untested changes directly to production.
- Feature flags can help roll out integrations gradually.
- Monitor performance after deployment and adjust configurations as needed.

13. Miscellaneous
- Use consistent naming conventions for resources and endpoints.
- Avoid long-running synchronous calls; use asynchronous processing where possible.
- Handle retries and failures in a way that maintains data consistency.
- Review integration logs regularly to detect anomalies early.
- Keep a checklist of common pitfalls to prevent repeated mistakes.
