# Installation Guide — Company AI Support System

Overview
This guide explains how to install, configure, and run the Company AI Support System.
The application is built with Java 17, Maven, and a connection to Gemini API for AI responses.
It supports both console and REST modes.

System Requirements

* Java 17 or later (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)
* Maven 3.8.0+
* Internet connection (for Gemini API access)
* 2 GB of free RAM minimum
* Operating System: Windows 10+, macOS 12+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)

Checking Java and Maven Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Verify Java:
   java -version
   Expected output example:
   openjdk version "17.0.11"
3. Verify Maven:
   mvn -v
   If Maven is missing, install it:

   * On macOS: brew install maven
   * On Ubuntu: sudo apt install maven
   * On Windows: download from [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone [https://gitlab.com/company/ai-support-system.git](https://gitlab.com/company/ai-support-system.git)
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd ai-support-system
3. Install dependencies:
   mvn clean install

Environment Variables
Before running the application, set the Gemini API key.

Windows:
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"

macOS / Linux:
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

Make sure to restart your terminal after setting the variable.

Configuration
The system uses a configuration file located at:
src/main/resources/application.properties

You can modify the following settings:
app.mode=console          # 'console' or 'api'
app.language=en
app.logging=true

Optional: You can also create a .env file in the project root:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
APP_MODE=console

Running the Application
To start in console mode:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.agents.Main"

To start the REST API server (if implemented):
mvn spring-boot:run

When the application starts, you should see:
Start chatting (type 'exit' to quit):

Troubleshooting Installation Issues
Problem: “Port already in use” when running Spring Boot.
Solution: Change the server port in application.properties:
server.port=8081

Problem: “NullPointerException in ConfigLoader.”
Cause: Missing environment variable or missing configuration file.
Fix: Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set and file application.properties exists.

Problem: “Model not found: gemini-2.5-flash.”
Cause: Incorrect model name or outdated SDK.
Fix: Check your dependency version and use gemini-2.5-flash or a supported model.

Problem: “SSLHandshakeException.”
Fix: Ensure system time and date are correct. This error can occur if your local SSL certificates are outdated.

Problem: “Maven build failed.”
Fix: Try:
mvn clean install -U
to force Maven to re-download dependencies.

Updating the Application
To update the project to the latest version:
git pull origin main
mvn clean install

If you made local changes, commit or stash them first:
git add .
git commit -m "local update"
git pull --rebase

Uninstallation
To remove the system:

1. Delete the project folder:
   rm -rf ai-support-system
2. Optionally, remove cached dependencies:
   rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/com/example/agents

Support
If you encounter problems not covered here:

* Check the troubleshooting.txt document for runtime issues.
* Verify your API key and internet connection.
* Contact the internal DevOps team at [support@company.ai](mailto:support@company.ai)
